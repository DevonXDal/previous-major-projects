Once created, only one copy of it will exist and many objects will have references to that one reference. When an action is performed the controller can be notified and the action carried out if able. When the game is started or restarted, the controller will handle the setup of the game board. }{\pageref{class_earn_shards_for_cards_1_1_shared_1_1_data_1_1_gin_rummy_1_1_gin_rummy_controller}}{}

It is necessary to have this to separate concerns from other objects and to track conditions for actions either player takes. This information includes the current round, scores for each player per round, which variations of the rules are in use, whose turn it is and the phase, etc. Using this state helps the game flow and aids in determining if a player has won the game. }{\pageref{class_earn_shards_for_cards_1_1_shared_1_1_data_1_1_gin_rummy_1_1_gin_rummy_game_state}}{}
